# Testing an order processing application
## Goal
The goal of this lab is to familiarize you with validating your app and customizations with existing and new ATF features. You will be testing the Order processing system application that is already on your lab instance. 

We will be using an app - currently under development - called "Order Tracking System". This app allows an employee to place a product order request via service catalog.
